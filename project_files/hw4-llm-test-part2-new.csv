personally, i think that this is van's best, most well-rounded album since too long in exile. it has all the joyful bounce of street choir and moondance as well as a taste of his introspective mid-period moods.
my favorites are talk is cheap, choppin' wood (ok, the background vocals are obnoxious but its still a great song), the maligned all work and no play (its those background vocals again), the soulful whatever happened to pj proby, only a dream, and evening shadows.
that last merits special mention. originally written as an instrumental by 50s soft-jazz pioneer acker bilk, van adds lyrics to evening shadows which really fit the music then brings bilk aboard to do a clarinet solo on his own music brought to life! tremendous!
about the only song i don't care for is van's rendition of georgia on my mind, but then that song has never been a favorite anyhow.
i'm with the reviewer who said he did not care if van broke no new ground. he has given the world forty years of wonderful music and its hard to see what new ground he could possibly break. i highly recommend down the road to one and all.",All the Joy and Beauty of Days Gone By,1034640000,30.0,,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},CDs,a1451,1

after forever is a symphonic, gothic metal, beauty and beast band from the netherlands. they are a sextet but they also use guest musicians and singers to fill out their sound so it resembles a symphonic orchestra for a sound like many other popular european metal bands like fellow countrymen within temptation and norwegian band sirenia and not unlike nightwish and therion..

invisible circles

invisible circles is based on a story about a girl, who was born unwanted by her father, growing up in a loveless home. the girl learns at an early age, that she is unloved and throughout the album between the music are little suites of the parents talking and arguing. there are occasional growling vocals, which is supposed to be the girl's inner self talking to her consciousness.

probably the most notable member of the band is their highly acclaimed singer, floor jansen and even she seems to be struggling on this album, as her usually flawless voice seems both stretched and strident. the music is still symphonic metal with a backing orchestra and choir as in previous releases. what has changed is the bands approach. instead of the conventional medieval beauty and beast approach of their past the song writers have decided to veer off into a more contemporary, avant garde style. while i applaud their initiative and intent to create an operatic masterpiece, it seems they only succeeded in the creation of a soap opera.

while i'm usually taken with concept albums, invisible circles is an exception. in fact, for me, invisible circles was one of my larger musical disappointments of 2004. after forever's previous 2001 full album, decipher was truly a remarkable recording and i was so looking forward to more of the same but alas, they decided to thread a new path. what path is that? i'm afraid they got lost and found the path of uninteresting music. there are to few hooks, at least nothing that hooks my attention and the melodies are closer to odious than melodious. even the concept is uninteresting, being about the trials and tribulations of an unwanted little girl growing up in an unhappy family. i can see why mark jansen left and formed epica after listening to this and exordium, their preceding lackluster ep released in 2003. he obviously was not in agreement with the band's new musical path.

i usually find floor jansen's voice to be perfect but for some unknown reason, on this album, i found her voice was grating, almost irritating, like she was too strident or something. now floor has one of the purest, most beautiful voices in the world but she seemed to be struggling at times with these songs.

i should point out that this album has received some rave reviews. god knows why but it seems there's always someone somewhere that will like something i dislike and vice versa, however, it's usually the other way around with me. when i and most other people are enthralled with a certain album, somebody will come along and rain on our parade. well this time it's moi who is precipitating the precipitation. not that this is a bad album, it's just a dull album, there`s nothing special.. no real highlights or highpoints and while a song may get interesting occasionally they manage to blow it before the song ends. in the past, after forever has been one of the leading symphonic beauty and beast bands and though they still show some symphonic elements, they're now leaning in a more progressive direction. there is nothing wrong with that but they're half way there and what we have is not the best of either genre and where they retain some of the old sound, they fail to close the deal. give me back my ""leaden legacy"", ""monolith of doubt"", ""pledge of allegiance"", ""the key"", ""follow the cry"" and ""forlorn hope"". honestly, i can think of very little that appeals to me on this album.

this is an iconic album and along with roots, vulgar display of power, in the meantime, burn my eyes will stand the test of time and never get old.

prong are the evolution of killing joke into metal. even though killing joke are still around and still great, prong took the torch they dropped in the late 80's and created a great mix of metal and industrial like starkness.

i agree that at first listens the 2nd half of the cd doesn't have the immediate fire and hook of the first half but over time those latter songs became undiscovered gems to me as they give the cd diversity that helps it last.

it's interesting that in retrospect some of the best metal recordings to be made came at a time when the banners yelled metal is dead, long live alternative. no wonder metal is ""mostly"" lame now as it's so prominent and popular that it's fallen into the mass produced masses. a band like avenged sevenfold is no different to me than the goo goo dolls or any female pop singer.

shewee- when i used this product i had urine on my clothing. i tried using it 3 times with the same results. its very bulky and therefore not discrete, the clear tube must be used because the green funnel isn't long enough to exit the urine safely away from the body. it is made of hard plastic, so it will not collapse during use but still needs 2 hands because its so long and narrow you need to hold both ends. it comes with its own caring case, which is a plus. the part of the funnel you hold next to your body is extremely narrow, the funnel itself is so narrow if one was to release a large volume, quickly, i think it would overflow. you also need to wipe afterward because if you try to wipe yourself with it, its just to narrow, plus now you have 2 plastic pieces that are also wet (besides yourself and your clothing). this devise is generally hard to use, indiscrete (dark greenreally?) and bulky both to carry and use. i would give the shewee a rating of 1 star. i expected more from rei.

wiz freedom- out of the package, first try worked fine. its flexible and therefore needs both hands to keep it in place and prevent crimping. this devise was not very discrete, anyone seeing you from the side would wonder about this long bright pinkish-purple thing sticking out from between your legs. it doesnt come with a carrying case and i couldn't figure out how on earth i would carry this discreetly in my purse or use it in an emergency. it also  stays wet and theres the issue of self-clean-up, since you are wet after use. at least it doesnt wet your clothing so, i would give this 2 stars.

go girl- no leaking on first try, more difficult with elastic clothing due to the flexibility of the product, good discretion, you do need to use both hands to hold it tight to your body and keep it from crimping. i liked that it folded in half- and i could fit it into a small iphone case on my waist when not in use! i didn't like that there was still moisture in the devise and on my body when i finished, and therefore needed to wipe myself and figure out what to do with the paper. i would give this product 3 stars.

pstyle- worked great out of the package. just the right length, the color option of semi-clear lavender makes it discrete as well. because this devise is made of semi-flexible smooth plastic with rounded edges you can effectively use it to wipe yourself, when you are done. by gently pressing up and away from yourself, you are virtually dry- the last few drops go out the end. if you shake it, the pstle is virtually dry. as well if you want to really get it clean, just use a little water from your water bottle to shoot down the spout. if you buy the caring case you can pop the pstyle in there quickly and easily,  and carry on without any fuss. the case just looks like an eyeglasses case and is totally washable with a velcro closure. the case also comes in a blue-jean material, it can be hung on a belt loop or on the outside of a bag, purse or backpack with its mini carabiner. because it is semi-ridged it requires only 1 hand in the middle to hold it in place it won't collapse. it also will not overfill or back-up because it is not a funnel, its more of a half-pipe. this is the only one i use now. i would give the pstle 5 stars, with a big thank you to the people who designed and distributed this product.",I Tried 'Em All- Not Recommened,1433980800,205.0,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81vE2HDpbpL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/816p9iepDiL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81-lLGe6HlL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81T9+56X-OL._SY88.jpg']",{'Color:': ' Nato Green'},sports,a3049,0
